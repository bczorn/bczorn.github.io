My CLI project scrapes the [Houston Museum District website](http://houmuse.org/). The goal is to help plan your next trip to Houston, Texas. I have always loved the museum district, and I love that it provides fun and educational things to do, that doesn't break the bank. There are also so many options, it is a favorite thing of mine anytime of the year. My project gives the user some overview information about each museum as well as which museums are within walking distance. There are 19 museums within the museum district, each listed in numbered order.

This information comes from the main 'houmuse.org' webpage. Each page is only scraped once. From here you are able to type the number of which specific museum you want more information about.

The pages about each museum will give the user some overview information about that museum. It will also list the museums that are within walking distance.

After each output, it will ask what the user wants to do next. If the user inputs something that is not an option, it will return as invalid.

The user will type 'exit' to exit the program.
