Hello, my (new) name is Becky Holt, formerly Becky Zorn. I recently got married just a few months ago. I have been on my flatiron journey for quite a while now, although this is my first blog post. (oops?) I didn't even realize I was supposed to be blogging this entire time. Honestly though, it has been a rough one....

I earned my bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering and immediately out of college I got a transportation job with the railroad. Although it was a lot of hours, it was very good in the beginning. The railroad is a 150+ year old business and is 24/7/365. The railroad never stops. I really did love it in the beginning, I love learning new things and every day on the railroad you will learn something new. It was a lot of hours but I didn't mind it. Also, I have always naturally been a night owl. I could work nights, and instead of high heels I wore boots. Perfect! 

Fast forward five years, it had taken it's toll on me. My mental, physical, and emotional health had slowly been sacrificed each step of the way. I was miserable, but didn't feel like I had a way out. I had ideas, but was also too afraid to take that much needed step. Most of the 'bonding' with my co-workers involved us complaining to each other and talking about taking that step towards a better future. This went on for years. It is tough leaving a job, consistent salary, and the security that comes along with it. 

This is where Flatiron comes in. In college I did some coding, but it was not the sole focus of my studies. I knew I liked it a lot, and being an introvert, sitting behind a computer all day for a job was very appealing. My sister was the one who introduced Flatiron to me, and pretty soon I finally gained the confidence to quit my job (with the support of my husband) and persue a new career. It has not been easy for me though, my mental health struggles in addition to COVID has really taken a toll and set me back a lot. But I am determined to make this work. I owe it to everyone who has supported me on this journey, but most importantly, to myself.
